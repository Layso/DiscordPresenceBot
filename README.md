# DiscordPresenceBot
Long ago all nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Corona nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all required science and biology elements could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished..

So what do we do in these dark times? Work from home of course. As HES Games we also continue working remotely from our homes for everyones health and safety. As for the communication we use a Discord channel and this is a bot that I made for Administration to monitor user activity (okay maybe not so cool). What the bot does is a basic user presence check once in every hour with an emoji reaction and listing user start-end times for the day.

As this is my first complete Discord bot I can't say this is the way you should write a bot but you can get inspired and learn the usage of various API functions. Any comments and critique accepted. You can use the bot for you own channel by customizing or as is. Don't forget to set your channel and role IDs and give bot token as command line argument.
